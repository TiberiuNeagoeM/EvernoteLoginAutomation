  Here is my Evernote Maven Project with Java and Selenium
Prerequisites:
At the starting of the test a Note should already exist
All the dependencies are added to Pom.xml file

Framework description:
There are 4 files that construct this framework:
	- LoginTestingCest - This is the class that should be run in order to start the test. Here are the major methods called.
	- LoginTestingStep - Here are all the methods nested. 
	- LoginTestingPage - Here are all the locators and strings nested.
	- pom.xml 	   - Here are all the dependencies required. 
The test has all the methods nested in TestingLoginStep file.
The test has a method called OpenBrowser to initiate the ChromeDriver which is called at the start of the test.
There are 4 major methods created for each step of the test:
	- UnothorizedLogin - Is the method where I test the login process with bad credentials. This method has separated Chrome session
	- AuthorizedLogin  - Is the method where the login process is successfully completed
	- Write a note     - Is the method where the session where was left after AuthorizedLogin and creates a note 
			     with a title and a message and also logs out of the account and opened the note which was 
			     already created by the time when the test started
	- Move to trash     - Moves the note already existed before the test start in order to have
	the note previously created displayed
Beside this methods there are several other methods for
- Login	- Starts login session
- Logout - Starts logout session
- WaitForElementVisible - Waits an css element to get visible
- Log - Prints all the steps in console
